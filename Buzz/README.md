# Buzz

*Buzz* is a small assistant that helps remind teams of stand-ups, retrospectives, and other meeting hosts.

1. It updates the host list every morning based on the meeting's update frequency (PeriodType).

2. It sends the updated list to Slack (or other chat platforms) at scheduled times each day.

3. The host order can be adjusted via API, allowing you to skip someone if needed.

“Buzz” represents the sound of a little bee flapping its wings, much like how we all diligently work each day. We hope this tool can assist everyone in managing meeting reminders more efficiently.
